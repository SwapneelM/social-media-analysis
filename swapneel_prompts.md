# Swapneel Prompts

## Prompt 1 — 2026-02-19
relevant instructions for claude.md

1. Never make assumptions, always ask questions to clarify decisions
2. Document all the raw prompts I input in a file called swapneel_prompts.md where you store the instructions (except any sensitive details).
3. Ensure you always git commit after every single change you make (and check changes are committed before you make any file changes just to be sure).
4. Always write local tests in a folder called tests in order to ensure you document tests and run them to verify every single function and module you develop works as intended.
5. As you decompose an instruction into steps of actions to take, can you ensure you write these down so that it is easy to pick up where you leave off. Always write these files into a folder called `scratchpad` so that it is accessible, individually possible to run and test functionality.
6. For all code, always write docstrings, document it accurately and with a clean explanation of the use for the code as relevant. Add the code structure and any instructions needed for data or to run it in the README.md file that must always be up to date with the project goals, project data, and instructions to run it.
