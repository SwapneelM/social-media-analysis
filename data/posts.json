    "text": "\"Today at the New Delhi AI Impact Summit, I present the MANAV Vision for AI. MANAV means human, and MANAV Vision says: \n\n▪️M- moral and ethical systems: AI should be based on ethical guidance.\n▪️A- accountable governance means transparent rules, robust oversight.\n▪️N- national sovereignty means whose data, his right. \n▪️A- accessible and inclusive means AI should be a multiplier, not a monopoly. \n▪️V- valid and legitimate means AI should be lawful and verifiable. \n\nThis MANAV vision of India will become an important link for the welfare of humanity in the AI-based world of the 21st century.\"\n\n— Hon’ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi at the #IndiaAIImpactSummit2026\n\n#ResponsibleAI #PeoplePlanetProgress",
